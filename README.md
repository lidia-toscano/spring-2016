## Course Overview

- A research methods course is an important foundational course for any graduate program.  


## Course Objectives

1) To provide an understanding of basic many different research techniques and concepts related to scientific inquiry. 

2) To advance students along the research process by introducing the basic tools needed to critically analyze claims made through written and oral means, and determine the degree to which these claims are valid.

3) To help students not only in conducting research, but also in judging the validity of any claims made in articles and newspapers, trade journals, academic journals, briefings, presentations, and professional discussions.

4) To provide a foundation for students in designing and conducting their own research projects and determine how close to the truth they have come in their own efforts

## Class Content

Class time will be divided between lectures, discussion, and application of course content.  Lectures will highlight and expand upon points covered in the readings.  The class time should be used by you to ask about concepts that are not entirely clear to you.  Although I will try to get a feel for the students’ understanding of the material, it is always helpful for me to hear it directly from you.  So, please take advantage of class time to ask about the material you don’t understand.  

Homework

There will be homework assignments to ensure students are grasping the material.  Understanding of material is a subjective judgment based on the assignment you turn in to me.  If you show little or no work, or provide little explanation, I have no way of understanding how you arrived at your answer.  Effort is also a subjective judgment based on the professionalism of your work.  I expect that your assignments will be legible, free of misspellings, properly cited, etc.  

Quizzes

There will be multiple pop quizzes throughout the quarter.  The quizzes will be given to determine the extent to which students understand the assigned reading and homework material.  The quizzes will consist of approximately ten questions or problems.  

Exams

All exams will be administered in class and will be a closed book format—no reference materials, texts, equation sheets or notes will be allowed during the exams.  

A.  Mid-term Exam.  This exam will cover material contained in the first half of the quarter.  20-25% of the exam will cover important terms (i.e., vocabulary) that are discussed in the text or in class.  Another 20-25% will be short-answer questions that require the application of terms as given in scenarios.  The remaining 50-60% will require students to solve problems or address research issues.  The expected length of the exam is two hours.

B.  Final Exam.  The final exam will cover material mainly from the second half of the class and will be similar in format to the midterm exam.  While the final exam is not intended to be comprehensive, some of the material covered in the second half of the class is inextricably linked to the foundational concepts covered in the first half of the class.  Therefore, make sure you understand the foundational concepts well the first time.  The expected length of the exam will be two hours.

## Grades

- You will have four opportunities to demonstrate your level of understanding of the material and ability to apply the concepts to practical problems.
